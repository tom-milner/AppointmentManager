## Currently working on:

- Making client able to view unavailable dates (Appointment Calendar).

  - using background-events. use rendering = "inverse background" https://fullcalendar.io/docs/background-events
  - need to parse workday times into moment objects to display on calendar.
  - make recurring using recurring-events https://fullcalendar.io/docs/recurring-events
  - change language in AppointmentCalendar to validDates - only available dates won't be disabled.

## In the future:

- Add repeat appointments functionality.
- Add group appointments functionality.
